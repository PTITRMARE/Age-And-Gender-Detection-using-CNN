# Age-And-Gender-Detection-using-CNN

Age  and gender information are very  important for various real world applications, such as social   understanding,   biometrics,   identity   verification,   video   surveillance,   human-computer interaction,   electronic   customer,   crowd   behavior   analysis,   online   advertisement,   item recommendation, and many more. Despite their huge applications, being able to automatically predicting age and gender from face images is a very hard problem, mainly due to the various sources of intra-class variations on the facial images of people, which makes the use of these models in real world applications limited. There are numerous works proposed for age and gender prediction in the past several years. The earlier works were  mainly based on hand-crafted features extracted facial images followed by a classifier. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework to jointly predict the age and gender from  face images. Given the intuition that some local regions of the face have more clear signals about the age and gender of an individual (such as beard and mustache for male, and wrinkles  around eyes and mouth for age), we use an attentional  convolutional network as one of our backbone models, to better attend to the salient and informative part of the face. As we can see, the model outputs are mostly sensitive to  the edge patterns around facial parts, as well as wrinkles, which are important for age and  gender prediction
